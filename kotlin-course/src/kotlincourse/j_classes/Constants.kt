/*
 Like val, variables defined with the const keyword are immutable.
 The difference here is that const is used for variables that are known at compile-time.

 Declaring a variable const is much like using the static keyword in Java.

 The Kotlin compiler inlines the const val values into the locations where theyâ€™re used.
 This is more efficient than using mutable variables.
