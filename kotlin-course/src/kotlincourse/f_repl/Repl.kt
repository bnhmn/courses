/*
IntelliJ can run a Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) for Kotlin.

It is located under Tools -> Kotlin -> Kotlin REPL.

It allows you to interactively execute Kotlin code
like if Kotlin was a scripting language like Python.
Useful to quickly test some code.

Enter statements into the REPL terminal and Press Ctrl-Enter to execute.
